# Motivation

My goal is to develop the skills required to become a Full Stack Engineer by the end of 2025.

To achieve this, I wanted to dive into a hands-on project. Building a portfolio website was the perfect choice, as it allowed me to showcase my skills while exploring both frontend and backend development.

I specifically implemented a contact form and a dashboard to gain practical experience with server-side logic and APIs, giving me exposure to the backend alongside the frontend.
